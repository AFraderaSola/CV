# Albert Fradera-Sola CV

Here you can find the scripts to generate a .pdf and .html version of my curriculum vitae. They are based on Nick Strayer's datatdivencv R package (http://nickstrayer.me/datadrivencv/), from which I adapted the code. 

Additionally, you can find the data to generate a network of my CV as explained in my website tutorial (https://afraderasola.github.io/project/cvnetwork/)
