PLOS one,"Perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne) is a forage and amenity grass species widely cultivated in temperate regions worldwide. As such, perennial ryegrass populations are exposed to a range of environmental conditions and stresses on a seasonal basis and from year to year. One source of potential stress is limitation on water availability. The ability of these perennial grasses to be able to withstand and recover after periods of water limitation or drought can be a key component of grassland performance. Thus, we were interested in looking at changes in patterns of gene expression associated with increasing water stress. Clones of a single genotype of perennial ryegrass were grown under non-flowering growth room conditions in vermiculite supplemented with nutrient solution. Leaf and root tissue was sampled at 4 times in quadruplicate relating to estimated water contents of 35%, 15%, 5% and 1%. RNA was extracted and RNAseq used to generate transcriptome profiles at each sampling point. Transcriptomes were assembled using the published reference genome sequence and differential gene expression analysed using 3 different programmes, DESeq2, edgeR and limma (with the voom transformation), individually and in combination, deriving Early, Middle and Late stage comparisons. Identified differentially expressed genes were then associated with enriched GO terms using BLAST2GO. For the leaf, up-regulated differentially expressed genes were strongly associated with GO terms only during the Early stage and the majority of GO terms were associated with only down-regulated genes at the Middle or Late stages. For the roots, few differentially expressed genes were identified at either Early or Middle stages. Only one replicate at 1% estimated water content produced high quality data for the root, however, this indicated a high level of differential expression. Again the majority of enriched GO terms were associated with down-regulated genes. The performance of the different analysis programmes and the annotations associated with identified differentially expressed genes is discussed."
Journal of Cell Science,"Proper mitochondrial genome inheritance is key for eukaryotic cell survival, however little is known about the molecular mechanism controlling this process. Trypanosoma brucei, a protozoan parasite, contains a singular mitochondrial genome aka kinetoplast DNA (kDNA). kDNA segregation requires anchoring of the genome to the basal body via the tripartite attachment complex (TAC). Several components of the TAC as well as their assembly have been described, it however remains elusive how the TAC connects to the kDNA. Here, we characterize the TAC associated protein TAP110 and for the first time use ultrastructure expansion microscopy in trypanosomes to reveal that TAP110 is the currently most proximal kDNA segregation factor. The kDNA proximal positioning is also supported by RNAi depletion of TAC102, which leads to loss of TAP110 at the TAC. Overexpression of TAP110 leads to expression level changes of several mitochondrial proteins and a delay in the separation of the replicated kDNA networks. In contrast to other kDNA segregation factors TAP110 remains only partially attached to the flagellum after DNAse and detergent treatment and can only be solubilized in dyskinetoplastic cells, suggesting that interaction with the kDNA might be important for stability of the TAC association. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the TAC, but not the kDNA, is required for correct TAP110 localization in vivo and suggest that TAP110 might interact with other proteins to form a >669 kDa complex."
bioRxiv,"Trypanosoma brucei is a single celled eukaryotic parasite in the group of the Excavates. T. brucei cells harbor a single mitochondrion with a singular mitochondrial genome, that consists of a unique network of thousands of interwoven circular DNA molecule copies and is termed the kinetoplast DNA (kDNA). To ensure proper inheritance of the kDNA to the daughter cells the genome is linked to the basal body, the master organizer of the cell cycle in trypanosomes. The structure connecting the basal body and kDNA is termed the tripartite attachment complex (TAC). Using a combination of proteomics and RNAi (depletomics) we test the current model of hierarchical TAC assembly and identify TbmtHMG44 and Tb927.11.16120 as novel candidates of a structure that connects the TAC to the kDNA. Both proteins localize in the region of the unilateral filaments between TAC102 and the kDNA and depletion of each leads to a strong kDNA loss phenotype. TbmtHMG44 and Tb927.11.16120 stably associate with extracted flagella, even after DNase treatment however they do require the kDNA for initial assembly. Furthermore we demonstrate that recombinant Tb927.11.16120 is a DNA binding protein and thus a promising candidate to link the TAC to the kDNA."
RNA,"Telomeric repeat-containing RNA (TERRA) molecules play important roles at telomeres, from heterochromatin regulation to telomerase activity control. In human cells, TERRA is transcribed from subtelomeric promoters located on most chromosome ends and associates with telomeres. The origin of mouse TERRA molecules is, however, unclear, as transcription from the pseudoautosomal PAR locus was recently suggested to account for the vast majority of TERRA in embryonic stem cells (ESC). Here, we confirm the production of TERRA from both the chromosome 18q telomere and the PAR locus in mouse embryonic fibroblasts, ESC, and various mouse cancer and immortalized cell lines, and we identify two novel sources of TERRA on mouse chromosome 2 and X. Using various approaches, we show that PAR-TERRA molecules account for the majority of TERRA transcripts, displaying an increase of two to four orders of magnitude compared to the telomeric 18q transcript. Finally, we present a SILAC-based pull-down screen revealing a large overlap between TERRA-interacting proteins in human and mouse cells, including PRC2 complex subunits, chromatin remodeling factors, DNA replication proteins, Aurora kinases, shelterin complex subunits, Bloom helicase, Coilin, and paraspeckle proteins. Hence, despite originating from distinct genomic regions, mouse and human TERRA are likely to play similar functions in cells. "
PLOS one,"Ryegrasses (Lolium spp.) and fescues (Festuca spp.) are closely related and widely cultivated perennial forage grasses. As such, resilience in the face of abiotic stresses is an important component of their traits. We have compared patterns of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in roots and leaves of two perennial ryegrass genotypes and a single genotype of each of a festulolium (predominantly Italian ryegrass) and meadow fescue with the onset of water stress, focussing on overall patterns of DEGs and gene ontology terms (GOs) shared by all four genotypes. Plants were established in a growing medium of vermiculite watered with nutrient solution. Leaf and root material were sampled at 35% (saturation) and, as the medium dried, at 15%, 5% and 1% estimated water contents (EWCs) and RNA extracted. Differential gene expression was evaluated comparing the EWC sampling points from RNAseq data using a combination of analysis methods. For all genotypes, the greatest numbers of DEGs were identified in the 35/1 and 5/1 comparisons in both leaves and roots. In total, 566 leaf and 643 root DEGs were common to all 4 genotypes, though a third of these leaf DEGs were not regulated in the same up/down direction in all 4 genotypes. For roots, the equivalent figure was 1% of the DEGs. GO terms shared by all four genotypes were often enriched by both up- and down-regulated DEGs in the leaf, whereas generally, only by either up- or down-regulated DEGs in the root. Overall, up-regulated leaf DEGs tended to be more genotype-specific than down-regulated leaf DEGs or root DEGs and were also associated with fewer GOs. On average, only 5–15% of the DEGs enriching common GO terms were shared by all 4 genotypes, suggesting considerable variation in DEGs between related genotypes in enacting similar biological processes."
PLOS Pathogens,"A cascade of histone acetylation events with subsequent incorporation of a histone H2A variant plays an essential part in transcription regulation in various model organisms. A key player in this cascade is the chromatin remodelling complex SWR1, which replaces the canonical histone H2A with its variant H2A.Z. Transcriptional regulation of polycistronic transcription units in the unicellular parasite Trypanosoma brucei has been shown to be highly dependent on acetylation of H2A.Z, which is mediated by the histone-acetyltransferase HAT2. The chromatin remodelling complex which mediates H2A.Z incorporation is not known and an SWR1 orthologue in trypanosomes has not yet been reported. In this study, we identified and characterised an SWR1-like remodeller complex in T. brucei that is responsible for Pol II-dependent transcriptional regulation. Bioinformatic analysis of potential SNF2 DEAD/Box helicases, the key component of SWR1 complexes, identified a 1211 amino acids-long protein that exhibits key structural characteristics of the SWR1 subfamily. Systematic protein-protein interaction analysis revealed the existence of a novel complex exhibiting key features of an SWR1-like chromatin remodeller. RNAi-mediated depletion of the ATPase subunit of this complex resulted in a significant reduction of H2A.Z incorporation at transcription start sites and a subsequent decrease of steady-state mRNA levels. Furthermore, depletion of SWR1 and RNA-polymerase II (Pol II) caused massive chromatin condensation. The potential function of several proteins associated with the SWR1-like complex and with HAT2, the key factor of H2A.Z incorporation, is discussed."
Nature Communications,"Telomeres are bound by dedicated proteins, which protect them from DNA damage and regulate telomere length homeostasis. In the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, a comprehensive understanding of the proteins interacting with the telomere sequence is lacking. Here, we harnessed a quantitative proteomics approach to identify TEBP-1 and TEBP-2, two paralogs expressed in the germline and embryogenesis that associate to telomeres in vitro and in vivo. tebp-1 and tebp-2 mutants display strikingly distinct phenotypes: tebp-1 mutants have longer telomeres than wild-type animals, while tebp-2 mutants display shorter telomeres and a Mortal Germline. Notably, tebp-1;tebp-2 double mutant animals have synthetic sterility, with germlines showing signs of severe mitotic and meiotic arrest. Furthermore, we show that POT-1 forms a telomeric complex with TEBP-1 and TEBP-2, which bridges TEBP-1/-2 with POT-2/MRT-1. These results provide insights into the composition and organization of a telomeric protein complex in C. elegans."
