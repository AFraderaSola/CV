# Scerevisiae_RBPs_Interactome

Code and data for the *S. cerevisiae* RBP interactome project. Data from this project is published under the following title:

**"RNA-dependent interactome allows network-based assignment of RBP functionality"**
  
Within this repository, the code to generate all the analysis and figures on the paper 
is provided.

The repository is structured in three main folders. Each folder contains its analysis scripts, ordered in a numeric fashion. Finally, for each script, there is a sub-folder for the input (when needed) and output files, matching the script number.

## 00_Candidates folder

This folder contains scripts that analyze and describe the characteristics of our candidates. Within this folder you can find the scripts to generate the following figures:

- Supplementary Figure 1

- Supplementary Figure 4C

## 01_IPscreen folder

This folder contains all the scripts used to analyze the MS data for the immunoprecipitation screen described in Figure 1B. Within this folder you can find the scripts to generate the following figures:

- Figure 2A, 2B, 2C, 2D and 2E

- Figure 3A, 3B, 3C, 3D and 3E

- Figure 5A, 5B, 5C and 5D

- Figure 6A, 6B, 6C and 6D

- Figure 7A, 7B, 7C and 7D

More details on the scripts and input files on the folder.
